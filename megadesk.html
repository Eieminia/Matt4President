    <h1>About the Megadesk</h1>
    <h3>Megadesk is one of the seven wonders of the Rose 23-24 campus. Being located in Blumberg room 308, the Megadesk is a conglomeration of Matthew Bonilla and Evan O'Brien's desks; but this isn't the only thing that makes it mega, as it is also decked out a variety of trinkets and gizmos. One of the more notable details of the Megadesk is the LED light sign denoting the strength of the desk. The Megadesk is also a sign of universal peace and tranquility and has also been the basis of many unique and inspiring ideas. </h3>
